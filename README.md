# Store Front End

The Store FrontEnd Project is an Angular based web application that serves the user with a product catalog, a product view tab when the image is pressed, the ability to add items to a cart and view the cart/checkout. The project demonstrates the use of different components and services and how they all make up the overall single webpage in regards to handling UI, business logic and data being shared between components etc.

Product catalog is obtained via a local data.json file but the code can be easily changed to interact with any API that interacts with a database, as the service that obtains the sample data (via data.json), uses HTTP requests to obtain the product catalog.
